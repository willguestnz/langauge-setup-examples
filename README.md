# Weather Data Collection Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of scripts written in Python, JavaScript, .NET (C#), and Rust. Each script in this repository is designed to perform the same core functionality: fetching and processing weather data for a specified location. The `README.md` in each folder will tell you how to install the required components and run the scripts on your machine (Windows and Linux).

## Functionality

The scripts are designed to:
- Fetch hourly weather data, specifically the temperature 2 meters above ground, for Berlin, Germany.
- Process the fetched data to extract and log the time and corresponding temperature.
- Handle errors gracefully during the fetch or processing stages.

## Languages

- **Python**: Ideal for those who prefer a high-level, dynamically typed language that emphasizes readability and rapid development.
- **JavaScript**: Suited for developers working in web environments or those familiar with Node.js for server-side scripting.
- **.NET (C#)**: Perfect for those in the Microsoft ecosystem or needing to integrate with other .NET applications.
- **Rust**: Offers memory safety without garbage collection, suitable for low-level systems programming or high-performance applications.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willguestnz/langauge-setup-examples
